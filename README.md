# Tasks
	A comprehensive group task management application that will become the only task management web application you'll ever want to work with. We've aimed to make this application simple and accessible while not compromising on power, functionality, and security.

## Description

Tasks is a project management app for students working on group projects. Tasks uses cards to visually display the flow of the project. A user can view all the tasks assigned to them by status or they can view all of the tasks in the project by status. This application was developed using Node.js with a mysql database, and an express server for backend tasks. This application was developed using the handlebars NPM framework, and CSS, along with Browser JavaScript for the frontend of the application. 

## Installation
